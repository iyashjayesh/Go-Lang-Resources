# Go Lang Resources

- Hey Folks üñêüèª, I'm maintaining this repository to keep track of all the resources I've used to learn Go Lang. I'll keep adding more resources as I learn more. Feel free to contribute to this repo.

- If you're new to Go Lang, I'd recommend you to start with the [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) website. It's a great place to start with Go Lang. It has a lot of examples and exercises to get you started with Go Lang.
